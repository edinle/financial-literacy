                Half of your income should go toward essential expenses that you can’t
                live without, such as rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, and
                tuition/minimum loan payments. Needs are your top priority, as they cover
                your basic living requirements.

            shopping. It’s important to enjoy your money responsibly while sticking
            to this budget to avoid overspending on luxuries.

            The final 20% is dedicated to your future. This includes building an

            stability and peace of mind.
